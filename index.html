            <p>Enid Mary Blyton is my favourite author. I have read almost every book she has written. She is a talented writer and have stories that keep the reader's attention till the end. While she might have similar ideas like the Famous Five and Secret Seven or Malory Towers and St.Clare's she is still a very good writer. She has tons of books including fiction, mystery, fantasy etc. I love her books and stay up all night reading them. You all should give her books a try!!</p>
